# Manalytics

Manalytics is a React Native app that allows a user to track elements of a game of Magic: The Gathering. Initially, it will only track life, but will eventually be extended to track other items to collect data for your Manalytics.app deck profile.

5/13/25 Known Issues:

- The app does not currently support dark mode.
- The `headerRight` button to open the settings screen appears mostly off of the screen in some instances. This is a [known issue with React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/8657) and I'm currently investigating workarounds.
